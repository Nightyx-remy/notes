	An equation is an expression of a relationship between <span class="salmon bold">quantities</span>, also called <span class="salmon bold">variables</span> or <span class="salmon bold">unknowns</span>.<br>
	A <span class="salmon bold">solution</span> of an equation is a <span class="salmon bold">value</span> for the variable(s) that makes the expression <span class="salmon bold">true</span> after substitution.<br>

	A differential equation is an expression of a relationship between a <span class="salmon bold">quantity</span> and the <span class="salmon bold">rate of change</span> of that same <span class="salmon bold">quantity</span>, or a relationship between a <span class="salmon bold">quantity</span> and its own <span class="salmon bold">derivative</span>.<br>
	A differential equation has two type of variable:<br>
	- The <span class="salmon bold">independant</span> variable.<br>
	- The <span class="salmon bold">dependant</span> variable.<br>
