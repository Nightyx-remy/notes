        A differential equation can be visualised in a sol called direction field.<br>
        This direction field is a drawing of small line segments in many points.<br>
        The line segment in point $P$ indicates in which <span class="salmon bold">direction</span> the solution of the equation goes, if the solution should pass $P$.<br>
        This <span class="salmon bold">direction</span> can be calculated by substituting the coordinates of $P$ into the differential equation.<br>

    <p class="note-head highlight-springgreen">Example</p>
    <p class="note-bg">
        $$\frac{dy}{dx}=- \frac{x}{y}$$
        Take the point $P_{1}(2, 1)$: $\frac{dy}{dx}=- \frac{2}{1} = -2$<br>
        Draw through $P_{1}$ a small line segment in this direction.<br>
        Take the point $P_{2}(5, 3)$:<br>
        $$\frac{dy}{dx}=-\frac{5}{3}$$
        Take the point $P_{3}(0, 5)$<br>
        $$\frac{dy}{dx} = - \frac{0}{5} = 0$$
        Repeat this in many points.<br>

    <p class="note-head highlight-blue">Boundary value</p>
    <p class="note-bg">
        The direction field show the kind of solutions for this equation: circles!<br>
        There are infinitely many solutions of the DE.<br>
        Which circle is the solution, depends on the boundary value.<br>
        If you know one point of a specific solution then the rest is fixed.<br>
