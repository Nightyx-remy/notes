<span class="blue bold">Calculate the dead time (the time between the turn off of PWM1 and turn on of PWM2)</span>.<br>

Since $R_{4} = R_{3}$ and $C_{1} = C_{2}$:
$t_{\Delta} = R_{3}\times C_{1} = 1k\times 1n = 1\mu s$<br>

<span class="blue bold">Verify the calculated dead time with the simulation results</span>.<br>

## Question 5 - Unipolar switching of a RL load with bleeding resistor across the load

I don't understand why it's saying the duty cycle is 0.55 and not 0.5 even thought the period, the rise time, the on time and the fall time hasn't been changed.<br>

$D = 0.5$<br>

<span class="blue bold">What is the average voltage across the RL load?</span>.<br>

$D = 0.55$<br>

$D = 0.75$<br>

## Question 6 - Bipolar switching RL load

$R1 = \frac{511448}{10000}= 51.1448\Omega$<br>

Simulation done with L = 10m instead of L = 5m, i compared my results with other people and there is not a big difference, the peaks are just more sharp.

## Question 7 - PWM for half bridge

$R1 = \frac{511448}{10000}= 51.1448\Omega$<br>

![](Power%20Circuits/res/assignment5/5.7.circuit.png)

<span class="blue bold">Show in a simulation the voltage across and current through the RL load</span>.<br>

<span class="blue bold">Show in a simulation the source currents</span>.<br>

![](Power%20Circuits/res/assignment5/5.7.4.2.png)

<span class="blue bold">For which duty cycle D there is the maximum ripple in the current?</span>.<br>

![](Power%20Circuits/res/assignment5/simu2.png)

![](Power%20Circuits/res/assignment5/simu3.png)

The ripple current is the biggest at $t = 2.9ms$.<br>
Since the duty cycle changes linearly and at $t = 2ms, D = 0.8$ and at $t = 4ms, D = 0$:<br>
$D = \frac{0.8 }{ (4 - 2)} \times (2.9 - 2) = 0.36$<br>
The ripple current is the biggest when $D \approx 0.36$<br>
